# **Client Churn Prediction — End-to-End ML System**
*Production-ready machine learning pipeline for real-time churn prediction.*

---

## Project Overview

This project implements a **full end-to-end ML system** designed to predict customer churn for a telecom company.  
The goal was not just to train a model, but to build a **production-oriented solution** ready for integration into a real-time scoring environment.

The system receives customer attributes and predicts whether they are likely to churn:

- **"1" — customer will likely churn**
- **"0" — customer will likely stay**

The project follows an industry-style workflow: data preprocessing → feature engineering → model training → evaluation → real-time prediction function.
